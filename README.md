# Bubble & eat
This is a demo application for [Monolith](https://github.com/or-bit/monolith),
a framework to build interactive bubble in every chat system.

Bubble & eat is an app for manage restaurant services in a simple and fast way,
just like writing a message on your favourite chat-app.

Main feature:
- it is available on every platform, so you can make an order from home,
from school or even from the bus;
- it can be integrated in [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/) (and every other
app), so you can stop to receive thousands of message of your friends telling what
they want to eat, and just make them put it in a bubble, shared by everyone you want.
